The goal of Project Synthesis is to unify task planning and calendar functions under one program, with a significant added feature to absolutely minimize friction when determining what task to do next.

I struggle to remember everything I need to do. My current system is to make a list of every todo item that I think of. Each day I move the most important items into that day's Action Items. This shuffling around is tiresome. As the list grows longer, it will become even more tiresime. This will not scale well. What I need is a system that can sort through that huge list of to-do items for me. It needs to automatically esimate which items are the most imporant and highlight them for me to do.

If you input some information to create a contextual framework, the system can make assumptions about travel time, setup time, etc, and put together suggestions for how to best use your open time slots. This is what I call a dynamic planner; a planner that addapts on the fly as viables change and flexibility is needed. Instead of having to re-arrange your schedule when something changes, *it re-arranges itself*.
